SubQuery : 가상의 테이블을 하나 더 만들어서 질의한다.
Ex)
select daily_stats.week, avg(daily_stats.incidents_daily)
from (
	select week, date, count(incident_id) as incidents_daily
	from crimes
	group by week, date
	) daily_stats
group by daily_stats.week

Ex)
select *
from crimes
where date = (select min(date) from crimes) // 서브쿼리의 결과물이 1개여야만 한다.

Ex)
select *
from crimes
where date in (select date from crimes order by date desc limit 5)
